                    I have always been passionate about technology and its applications. Throughout my college education
                    at Georgian College, I have gained a solid foundation in computer programming and have developed a
                    strong understanding of various programming languages, such as Java, Python, and C++. I have also
                    gained experience in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have worked on projects
                    that involved creating responsive and user-friendly websites. </br><br>

                    During my time at college, I actively participated in group projects, which helped me enhance my
                    teamwork and collaboration skills. I have learned how to effectively communicate and coordinate with
                    team members to achieve project goals within deadlines. Additionally, I have gained experience in
                    database management, including designing and implementing efficient database systems using SQL.
                    <br><br>

                    I am a quick learner and always stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field of
                    computer programming. I regularly engage in self-study, exploring new technologies and programming
                    frameworks to expand my knowledge and expertise. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my
                    skills and contribute to a team that values innovation and continuous learning.<br><br>

                    In addition to my technical skills, I possess strong organizational and detail-oriented
                    capabilities. My communication skills are well-developed, which I believe would make me an asset to
                    your team. Furthermore, I also practical knowledge of Software Application, MEAN Framework
                    JavaScript, Linux OS operating. I also have a good understanding of software development life cycles
                    with 7 different phases of development. These skills have equipped me to tackle the challenges of
                    the position and contribute effectively to your team.<br><br>
